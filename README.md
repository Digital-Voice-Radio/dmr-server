### Digital Voice DMR Server 

* Forked from [FreeDMR](https://gitlab.hacknix.net/hacknix/FreeDMR)
* Heavily diverged from [hblink3](https://github.com/HBLink-org/hblink3)

Documentation and example configuration can be found at [docs](https://dvdmr.org/docs)


The intention wth this code base is to merge new and experimental features from both FreeDMR,  hblink3  and the hbnet project.
